      <description>As anyone who has run a network measurement test more than once will tell you, a single measurement is not as good as the trend of test results over time. Measurement Lab’s (M-Lab) extension for Google Chrome lets you schedule tests and see trends over time, but you have to leave Chrome open all the time to get the benefit. Other measurement initiatives like RIPE Atlas, OONI, and others, have developed a small, dedicated testing device that’s connected to a network which runs tests automatically.</description>

      <title>Mozfest and Matrix, Part 2</title>

      <description>My estimates of what we need to accomplish before MozFest are roughly:
 Get a RaspberryPi 3 and install Raspbian Lite as well as synapse Install PostgreSQL to serve as synapse&amp;rsquo;s database instead of sqlite  Configure synapse  Engage with MozFest wranglers to determine appropriate network settings (hostname, DNS, WiFi, etc.)  Figure out a carrying case or some way to make it all portable Figure out a display of some kind Determine how to display visualizations, and what synapse APIs are usable for this purpose  Prepopulate logins database table with registration info from MozFest (and ponder privacy concerns)  Think about data retention post MozFest   There&amp;rsquo;s almost certainly other tasks I&amp;rsquo;m not thinking of at the moment.</description>
