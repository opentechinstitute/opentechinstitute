      <description>As anyone who has run a network measurement test more than once will tell you, a single measurement is not as good as the trend of test results over time. Measurement Lab’s (M-Lab) extension for Google Chrome lets you schedule tests and see trends over time, but you have to leave Chrome open all the time to get the benefit. Other measurement initiatives like RIPE Atlas, OONI, and others, have developed a small, dedicated testing device that’s connected to a network which runs tests automatically.</description>
